# Homework 2

## Problem 1.5

```{r}
dbplot = FALSE
data("fig1.21a")
plotts.parzen.wge(fig1.21a)
```


## Problem 1.6

Generate a realization of the following equation of length 100.
Discuss the plots that show the periodic behavior.

$$
X_t = 3cos(2\pi(0.05)t) + 1.5cos(2\pi(0.35)t) + 2) + N(0,1)
$$

The sample autocorrelation plot shows the dominant frequency well with the period of 20 visible (0.05).
The Parzen window and the periodogram both suggest a frequeny at 0.05 and 0.35.

```{r}
X_t = gen.sigplusnoise.wge(n = 100, coef = c(3, 1.5), freq = c(0.05, 0.35), psi = c(0, 2))
plotts.sample.wge(X_t)
```

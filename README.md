# LearningTS

Code and notes are my own.
However, the code and notes are based on Time Series (MSDS6373) developed at SMU by [Wayne Woodward](https://sites.smu.edu/des/registrar/RetiredFaculty/?a=bio&pid=101&name=Wayne%20Woodward) and [Bivin Sadler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bivin-sadler-89825812/). 
This repo references the version of the class taught in Spring 2020 by Bivin Sadler.
Class lectures are referenced by the title in each file but, are not publicly available.
The repo for this class is located [here](https://github.com/BivinSadler/MSDS-6373-Time-Series).
References for books used are given in each file.

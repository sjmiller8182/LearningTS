    "# **Autoregressive Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoregressive models are expressed as dependence on lagged values.\n",
    "These types of models are generally good are modeling stationary processes that move forward in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1st Order: AR(1)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The first order autoregressive model AR(1) is expressed as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X_t = \\beta + \\phi X_{t-1} + a_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\beta = (1-\\phi)\\mu$\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is sometime written in zero-mean form as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X_t = \\phi X_{t-1} + a_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpretation of AR(1) is \"the value of the process at time $t$ depends on the value of the process at $t-1$ plus a random noise component.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Properties of AR(1)**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several properties that depend on the value of $\\phi$ and the sign of $\\phi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General\n",
    "\n",
    "* An AR(1) is stationary if and only if $ \\left| \\phi \\right| < 1$\n",
    "    * The expexted value of an AR(1) model is $\\mu$\n",
    "    * The variance is finite if and only if $ \\left| \\phi \\right| < 1$\n",
    "    * The autocorrelation depends only on k: $\\rho_k = \\phi^k, k > 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Positive $\\phi$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Realizations apprear to be wandering (aperiodic).\n",
    "* Autocorrelations are damped exponentials.\n",
    "* Spectral densities have peaks at sero.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Negative $\\phi$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Realizations seem to be oscillating.\n",
    "* Autocorrelations are damped oscillating exponentials\n",
    "* Spectral densities have peaks at $f = 0.5$\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Non-Stationary \"AR(1) Types\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Realizations with $\\left| \\phi \\right| = 1$, look similar to realizations that are encountered in practice.\n",
    "These are a special case of ARIMA realizations.\n",
    "Realizations with $\\left| \\phi \\right| > 1$, do not looks like real realizations in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Characteristic Equation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The characteristic equation of an AR(1) model can be found by using [backshift notation](backshift_operator.ipynb) to factor the model.\n",
    "Shown here with the zero mean form AR(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X_t - \\phi X_{t-1} = a_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Noting that $B X_t = X_{t-1}$ and setting $a_t$ to 0\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(1-\\phi B)X_t = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The characteristic equation is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(1-\\phi B) = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the root is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "root = \\frac{1}{\\phi}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since AR(1) is stationary if and only if $ \\left| \\phi \\right| < 1$, then an AR(1) model will be stationary if the root of the characteristic equation is $ \\left| \\frac{1}{\\phi} \\right| > 1$.\n",

    "## **Sinusiod Review**\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The general form a sample sinusoid function is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$sin \\left( 2\\pi f t + \\phi \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "* $f$ is the **frequency**\n",
    "* $t$ is time\n",
    "* $\\phi$ is the **phase shift**\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common form is $$sin \\left( \\omega t + \\phi \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\omega$ is the **angular frequency** and $\\omega = 2 \\pi f$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The **period** of a signal ($T$) is in reciprocal of the frequency \n",

    "T = \\frac{1}{f}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Frequency** is the *number of cycles per unit time*.\n",
    "**Period** is the *amout of time for one cycle to complete*.\n",

    "## **Main Ideas of Frequency Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ideas behind frequency analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many realizations are made up of various frequency components.\n",
    "* The frequency content may provide a better understanding of the process generating the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: spectral density of white noise if constant with an amplitude of one, \n",
    " meaning that all frequencies are unifformly present in white noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Periodic Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "A function $f$ is **periodic** *if and only if* $p$ is the smallest value such that $f(x) = f(x + k p)$\n",
    " for all x and integers k.\n",
    "If no value $p$ exists, the $f$ is aperiodic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real signals may be **psuedo-periodic** having a *similar* shape that repeats in a consistent cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Tranfromation to Frequency Domain**\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Signals can be transformed into the frequence domain with a \n",
    " **[Fourier Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform)** (periodic signals) or\n",
    " a **[Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series)** (aperiodic signals).\n",
    "Periodic signals can be directly transformed into the frequency domain by decomposition into\n",
    " a Fourier series because sine and cosine form a basis for the subspace of period functions.\n",
    "Aperiodic functions must be transformed with the Fourier transfrom,\n",
    " which can be used for any general aperiodic function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Spectral Density Estimation**\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectral density is given by \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S_x \\left( f \\right) = 1 + 2 \\sum^\\infty_{k=1} \\rho_k cos \\left( 2 \\pi f k \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The estimated **sample spectral density** is limited by the number of sample autocorrelations that can be estimated,\n",
    "exactly $N-1$ autocorrelations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The estimate of $S_x \\left( f \\right)$ is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{S}_x \\left( f \\right) = 1 + 2 \\sum^{N-1}_{k=1} \\hat{\\rho}_k cos \\left( 2 \\pi f k \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, because the later (high $k$) sample autocorrelations are low quality (estimated with a small number of samples)\n",
    " the sample spectral density components are \"smoothed\" with a window function to minimize the impact from low quality autocorrelations\n",
    " and the spectrum estimate is commonly truncated at $M < N-1$. \n",
    "A window function is represented by $\\lambda_k$, decreasing in magnitude with increasing $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The including window smoothing, the sample spectral density becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{S}_x \\left( f \\right) = \\lambda_0 + 2 \\sum^{N-1}_{k=1} \\lambda_k cos \\left( 2 \\pi f k \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ is a window function and $M$ is a truncation value (commonly $M = 2 \\sqrt{N}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Autocorrelation Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "The quality of autocorrelations is consider to decrease as the index $k$ increases.\n",
    "This is because the number of data points used to estimate the autocorrelation decreases incrementally as $k$ increases.\n",
    "At maximum $k$, the autocorrelation is estimated by one cross product $\\left( x_t - \\bar{x} \\right) \\left( x_{t+k} - \\bar{x} \\right)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plotting Sample Spectral Density\n",
    "\n",
    "On the raw frequency scale, frequency component peaks may be hard to see.\n",
    "It is common practice to plot the frequency magnitude in dB (10 $log$ 10).\n",
    "This transformation accentuates the frequency peaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Some Common Frequencies in Time Series**\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "* Yearly cycle: $\\frac{1}{12} = 0.083$\n",
    "* Daily cycle in hours: $\\frac{1}{24} = 0.0146$\n",
    "* Weekly cycle in hours: $\\frac{1}{168} = 0.006$\n",

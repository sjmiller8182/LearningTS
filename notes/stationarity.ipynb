    "\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The file covers the main features of a stationary time series.  \n",
    "An accompanying [Rmd file](../R/stationarity.md) is provided.\n",

    "## **Conditions**\n",

    "---------------\n",

    "### **Constant Mean**\n",
    "\n",
    "All subpopulations of $X_t$ have the same mean for each time $t$ \n",
    "i.e. the mean does not depend on time.\n",

    "\n",
    "The correlation of $X_2$ and $X_1$ only depends on $t_2-t_1$.\n",
    "That is, the correlation between the data points depends only on how far a part the obervations are in time,\n",

    "### **Checking Assumptions in Practice**\n",
    "\n",
    "For constant mean and variance, plot the time series and visually assess the validity of the assumption. \n",
    "For the constant autocorrelation, split the time series into subpopulations and \n",

    "---------------\n",

    "A single realization can be used to estimate the mean, variance, and \n",

    "Parameters can be estimated in the following order due to dependence:\n",

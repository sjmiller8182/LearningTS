    "\n",
    "## **Model-Free Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Several tools for model identification do not require models.\n",
    "The following are common model free tools\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sample spectral density\n",
    "* Sample ACF\n",
    "* Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Model-Dependent Techniques - Stationary Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The following model identification methods assume the time series is stationary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Model Identification Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Test $X_t$ for White Noise**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_o: X_t \\, is \\, white \\, noise\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_o: X_t \\, is \\, not \\, white \\, noise\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $X_t$ is white noise, we have the following expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "* $E [\\hat{\\rho}_k] = 0$ for $k>0$\n",
    "* $var \\left( \\hat{\\rho}_k \\right) \\sim 1 / n $\n",
    "* $ cov \\left( \\hat{\\rho}_k, \\hat{\\rho}_{k + 1} \\right) \\sim 0$\n",
    "* $ \\hat{\\rho}_k \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we reject $H_o$ at a 5% type 1 error rate if $ |\\hat{\\rho}_k| > 2 \\left( 1/ \\sqrt{n} \\right) $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Estimate Orders p, q**\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the model orders p, q are selected by a maximum likelihood estimate with AIC, AICc, or BIC.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the stationary case, AIC is calculated as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "AIC = ln \\left( \\hat{\\sigma}_a^2 \\right) + 2 \\left( \\frac{p + q + 1}{n} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to explain as much of the variation as reasonably possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Get Parameter Estimates for the Selected Model Order**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a model order is select, the model parameters can be estimated.\n",
    "Maximum likelihood (ML) estimates are typically used unless ML produces a model with root(s) in the unit circle.\n",
    "Other methods can be used to estimate AR-only models; these are discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: There is an alternative model ID method called the *Box-Jenkins* method.\n",
    "However, selecting a model by AIC is preferred of the Box-Jenkins method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **AR Model Parameter Estimation**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three methods for estimating AR paramters given the model order.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Yule-Walker\n",
    "  * Verfy fast calculation.\n",
    "  * The models produced will always be stationary.\n",
    "  * Models are low quality when roots are near the unit circle (should not be used if this is suspected).\n",
    "* Burg\n",
    "  * The models produced will always be stationary.\n",
    "  * An improvement on Yule-Walker because it makes use of more of the data.\n",
    "* Maximum Likelihood\n",
    "  * Best mathematical properties.\n",
    "  * May find models with roots inside the unit circle (these models cannot be used).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Model-Dependent Techniques - Non-Stationary Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### **ARIMA**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of ARIMA, the $\\left( 1 - B^d \\right)$ factors will dominate.\n",
    "The expected behavior is slowly damped exponential autocorrelations and wandering.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Box-Jenkins Model Identification Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Stationarize the Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Take differences of the data until the data appears to be stationary.\n",
    "The number of differences taken to stationarize the data is the order of $d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Model the Stationarized Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Model the stationarized data with the stationary modeling process described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **More General Model Identification Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Tiao-Tsay** result states that if a high order AR(p) model is fit to a realization from a non-stationary process,\n",
    "the factors associated with the roots on the unit circle will show up in the factor table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Fit a High Order AR Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "Fit a high order AR model to the realization.\n",
    "Get the factor table and find all the roots near unity.\n",
    "These likely represent non-stationary factors associated with process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Remove the Effects of the Non-Stationary Factors**\n",
    "\n",
    "Remove the effects of the non-stationary factors from the realization by differencing.\n",
    "Note that these factors maybe seasonal, ARIMA, or non-conforming (ARUMA).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Model the Stationarized Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Model the stationarized data with the stationary modeling process described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Seasonal**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the general approach to assess whether a seasonal model will be useful.\n",
    "Fit a high order AR(p) model then matchup roots in the overfit table that are close to the roots of the seasonal model.\n",
    "If many of the roots match, then a seasonal model may be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Deterministic - Linear Trend**\n",
    "\n",
    "The typicall approach of fitting an OLS model to $X_t$ vs time may lead to bad conclusions.\n",
    "The correlated errors lead to an inflated type 1 error rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cochrane-Orcutt procedure can be used to account for this.\n",
    "This fits an OLS model to the data, then fits an AR(1) to the noise.\n",
    "This is used to adjust the p-value of the slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fit a linear regression to $X_t$, getting $\\hat{a}, \\,\\, \\hat{b}$\n",
    "2. Calculate $Z_t$ as $Z_t = X_t - \\hat{a} - \\hat{b} t$\n",
    "3. Fit an AR(1) to $Z_t$, getting an estimate for $\\hat{\\phi}_1$\n",
    "4. Calculate $Y_t$ as follows\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The central assessment of model is whether it whitens the residuals.\n",
    "A model may be sufficient if the resulting residuals appear to be white noise.\n",
    "For an AR(p) model, there are $n-p$ *conditional residuals*.\n",
    "However, backcasting can be used to calculate all $n$ *unconditional residuals*.\n",

    "## **Model-Free Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Several tools for model identification do not require models.\n",
    "The following are common model free tools\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sample spectral density\n",
    "* Sample ACF\n",
    "* Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Model-Dependent Techniques - Stationary Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The following model identification methods assume the time series is stationary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Model Identification Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Test $X_t$ for White Noise**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_o: X_t \\, is \\, white \\, noise\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_o: X_t \\, is \\, not \\, white \\, noise\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $X_t$ is white noise, we have the following expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "* $E [\\hat{\\rho}_k] = 0$ for $k>0$\n",
    "* $var \\left( \\hat{\\rho}_k \\right) \\sim 1 / n $\n",
    "* $ cov \\left( \\hat{\\rho}_k, \\hat{\\rho}_{k + 1} \\right) \\sim 0$\n",
    "* $ \\hat{\\rho}_k \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we reject $H_o$ at a 5% type 1 error rate if $ |\\hat{\\rho}_k| > 2 \\left( 1/ \\sqrt{n} \\right) $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Estimate Orders p, q**\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the model orders p, q are selected by a maximum likelihood estimate with AIC, AICc, or BIC.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the stationary case, AIC is calculated as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "AIC = ln \\left( \\hat{\\sigma}_a^2 \\right) + 2 \\left( \\frac{p + q + 1}{n} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to explain as much of the variation as reasonably possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Get Parameter Estimates for the Selected Model Order**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a model order is select, the model parameters can be estimated.\n",
    "Maximum likelihood (ML) estimates are typically used unless ML produces a model with root(s) in the unit circle.\n",
    "Other methods can be used to estimate AR-only models; these are discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: There is an alternative model ID method called the *Box-Jenkins* method.\n",
    "However, selecting a model by AIC is preferred of teh Box-Jenkins method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **AR Model Parameter Estimation**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three methods for estimating AR paramters given the model order.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Yule-Walker\n",
    "  * Verfy fast calculation.\n",
    "  * The models produced will always be stationary.\n",
    "  * Models are low quality when roots are near the unit circle (should not be used if this is suspected).\n",
    "* Burg\n",
    "  * The models produced will always be stationary.\n",
    "  * An improvement on Yule-Walker because it makes use of more of the data.\n",
    "* Maximum Likelihood\n",
    "  * Best mathematical properties.\n",
    "  * May find models with roots inside the unit circle (these models cannot be used).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Model-Dependent Techniques - Non-Stationary Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### **ARIMA**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of ARIMA, the $\\left( 1 - B^d \\right)$ factors will dominate.\n",
    "The expected behavior is slowly damped exponential autocorrelations and wandering.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Box-Jenkins Model Identification Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Stationarize the Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Take differences of the data until the data appears to be stationary.\n",
    "The number of differences taken to stationarize the data is the order of $d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Model the Stationarized Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Model the stationarized data with the stationary modeling process described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **More General Model Identification Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Tiao-Tsay** result states that if a high order AR(p) model is fit to a realization from a non-stationary process,\n",
    "the factors associated with the roots on the unit circle will show up in the factor table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Fit a High Order AR Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "Fit a high order AR model to the realization.\n",
    "Get the factor table and find all the roots near unity.\n",
    "These likely represent non-stationary factors associated with process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Remove the Effects of the Non-Stationary Factors**\n",
    "\n",
    "Remove the effects of the non-stationary factors from the realization by differencing.\n",
    "Note that these factors maybe seasonal, ARIMA, or non-conforming (ARUMA).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Model the Stationarized Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Model the stationarized data with the stationary modeling process described above.\n",

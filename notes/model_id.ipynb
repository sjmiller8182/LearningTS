    "## **Model-Free Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Several tools for model identification do not require models.\n",
    "The following are common model free tools\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sample spectral density\n",
    "* Sample ACF\n",
    "* Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Model-Dependent Techniques - Stationary Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The following model identification methods assume the time series is stationary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Model Identification Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Test $X_t$ for White Noise**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_o: X_t \\, is \\, white \\, noise\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_o: X_t \\, is \\, not \\, white \\, noise\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $X_t$ is white noise, we have the following expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "* $E [\\hat{\\rho}_k] = 0$ for $k>0$\n",
    "* $var \\left( \\hat{\\rho}_k \\right) \\sim 1 / n $\n",
    "* $ cov \\left( \\hat{\\rho}_k, \\hat{\\rho}_{k + 1} \\right) \\sim 0$\n",
    "* $ \\hat{\\rho}_k \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we reject $H_o$ at a 5% type 1 error rate if $ |\\hat{\\rho}_k| > 2 \\left( 1/ \\sqrt{n} \\right) $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Estimate Orders p, q**\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the model orders p, q are selected by a maximum likelihood estimate with AIC, AICc, or BIC.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the stationary case, AIC is calculated as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "AIC = ln \\left( \\hat{\\sigma}_a^2 \\right) + 2 \\left( \\frac{p + q + 1}{n} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to explain as much of the variation as reasonably possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Get Parameter Estimates for the Selected Model Order**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a model order is select, the model parameters can be estimated.\n",
    "Maximum likelihood (ML) estimates are typically used unless ML produces a model with root(s) in the unit circle.\n",
    "Other methods can be used to estimate AR-only models; these are discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: There is an alternative model ID method called the *Box-Jenkins* method.\n",
    "However, selecting a model by AIC is preferred of teh Box-Jenkins method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **AR Model Parameter Estimation**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three methods for estimating AR paramters given the model order.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Yule-Walker\n",
    "  * Verfy fast calculation.\n",
    "  * The models produced will always be stationary.\n",
    "  * Models are low quality when roots are near the unit circle (should not be used if this is suspected).\n",
    "* Burg\n",
    "  * The models produced will always be stationary.\n",
    "  * An improvement on Yule-Walker because it makes use of more of the data.\n",
    "* Maximum Likelihood\n",
    "  * Best mathematical properties.\n",
    "  * May find models with roots inside the unit circle (these models cannot be used).\n",

    "Two of the common types of multivariate models are multiple regression with correlated errors and vector autoregression,\n",
    "which use exogeneous variables to help predict the response variable.\n",
    "In addition to using multiple variables at the same time $t$ as the response, \n",
    "lagged variables may be useful for predicting the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Lagged Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Lag effect - the value of a variable at a previous time is correlated with the repsonse at the current time.\n",
    "`dplyr::lag` can be used to lag variables in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cross-correlation between two variables at multiple lags may be useful in assessing if lags of a variable would be useful in the model.\n",
    "The cross-correlation between variables $X_{t1}$ and $X_{t2}$ at lag k is the correlation between $X_{t,1}$ and $X_{t-k,2}$.\n",
    "In R, the function `ccf` will calculate the cross-correlation between two variables for a given range of lags.\n",

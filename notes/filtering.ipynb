    "# **Filtering**\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept**: A filter takes in a signal and applies a transfomation that affects the frequency structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, there are four basic types of filters\n",
    "\n",
    "* Low pass - filters out high frequency\n",
    "* High pass - filters out low frequency\n",
    "* Band pass - filters out frequencies outside the band\n",
    "* Band stop - filters out frequencies inside the band\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Two simple examples of filters are the 1st order difference and the moving average.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1st Order Difference**\n",
    "\n",
    "The first order difference is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X_t = Z_t - Z_{t-1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Z_t$ is an input time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first order difference filter is a **high pass** filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Moving Average (5-point)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The 5-point moving average is defined as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X_t = \\frac{Z_{t+2} + Z_{t+ 1} + Z_{t} + Z_{t-1} + Z_{t-2}}{5}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Z_t$ is an input time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving average filters are **low pass** filters. \n",
    "The cut off frequency is set by the size of teh average.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **More Advanced Filters**\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "A well known more advanced filter is the [butterworth filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterworth_filter), which is known for haing a **maximally flat magnitude** frequency response.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Expression as a Tranformation**\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Filters can be expressed as transformations using [backshift notation](backshift_operator.ipynb) where the transformation is typically denoted as $H(B)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the 3-point moving average filter can be expressed as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X_t = \\frac{Z_{t+1} + Z_t + Z_{t-1}}{3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting for the backshift, we have\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X_t = Z_t \\frac{B^{-1} + B^0 + B^{-1}}{3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the backshift terms can be represented as a transformation $H(B)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H(B) = \\frac{B^{-1} + B^0 + B^{-1}}{3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And the 3-point moving average filter is expressed as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X_t =  Z_t H(B)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
